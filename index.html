                    I am a 23-year old Computer Engineering student in Mapua and 
                    currently studying Web Development in Avion School. To be really honest, I have just picked up the motivation
                    that I lost because of the pandemic. It has affected me so much, mentally. For more than a year, I have not been
                    able to attend most of the meetings in Mapua, resulting to failed subjects. My friends and I always regard myself
                    as the mentally stable one. I was caught off guard. I still have my goals, but I do not know how to reach them. While I was taking a shower, my heartbeat went fast. I realized that I needed to get everything together and start
                    making plans for my life. If I submit to every negativity, I would not be able to reach my goals. All I have to do is
                    take one step at a time. I saw an ad in Facebook about Avion School and suddenly grabbed the opportunity. Hopefully
                    this is the start of something. Okay that's enough drama.
